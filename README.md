When GitHub made private repos with unlimited collaborators a free core feature in 2019, many chose to migrate from Bitbucket.

You can use this CLI to automate that migration process.

The CLI assumes that you have SSH access to pull from Bitbucket and push to GitHub.

- [GitHub SSH instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

## Start

Run the following command from the root directory to start the CLI:

`$ npm start`
